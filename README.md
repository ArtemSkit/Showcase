## Project initiation

Before initiating a project and assigning the tasks talk to the team memebes and encourage them to use version control system. They have multiple choises, like GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab. These choises have the similar functionality. In this tutorial I will focus on GitHub since it's very popular platform, 37 million users.

The team leader will initiate the repository. Any pearson who worked on a software development team should be already familiar with the process of project initiation.
If they haven't used version control system before, they can learn how to use it from hundreds of free online tutorials. Othervise, the process of sharing code, commiting to the codebase, issue and progress tracking will soon become an unmanageble task.

During the process of project initialization GitHub will offer to include a licence agreement. The most popular types of open source licenses are **Apache License 2.0**, **GNU General Public License v3.0**, and **MIT license**. Please, get familiar with the provisions of each one of those and discuss with the team members which licence would be the most appropriate for the current project.

Once a ***PRIVATE*** project is initiated ask the team lead to add CivTech GitHub account as one of the collaborators so you have access to the project files and track the progress of the project. To add a collaborator to the project **the poject owner** which would be the team lead would have to open the repository page on GitHub, click on Settings -> Collaborators -> Add collaborator. If the team is conserned with CivTech having write permitions in their project they can make the **main/master branch** [potected](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-protected-branches). 
## Saving the progect files localy

The easiest way to save project files localy is to open the repository page and click on ***Download ZIP***

## Forking

You can always fork a poject. It will create a copy of the GitHub repository in **your** GitHub account and will make you the owner of this copy. This is how you can have an online catalog of the projects **with the source code** ready to be picked up by another team of developers. You would just need to include another team members as collaborators. !!! ***Unless it does not violate the terms of the original license agreement*** !!!
When you fork a project the new copy of the project will carry over all collaborators from the original verion to your copy. You may want to remove the collaborators from your forked copy so they can't change it.
